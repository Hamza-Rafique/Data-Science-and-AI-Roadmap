## 1. Why Python for Data Science?

Python is the go-to language for Data Science due to several reasons:

- **Simplicity**: Python has a readable and easy-to-learn syntax that is beginner-friendly.
- **Vast Libraries**: Python provides numerous libraries such as `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` that are crucial for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Community Support**: With an active and large community, Python has vast documentation, tutorials, and libraries that can assist in almost any challenge.
- **Integration**: Python integrates seamlessly with other programming languages and big data tools, making it versatile.

## 2. Setting Up Python

Before starting with Python, you need to set up the development environment. Here's how:

### Step 1: Install Python

- Download the latest version of Python from the official site: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- During installation, make sure to check the box for "Add Python to PATH."

### Step 2: Install an IDE or Code Editor

You can write Python code in any text editor, but it's recommended to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or code editor like:
- **VS Code**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **PyCharm**

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version ```

If the installation was successful, you should see an output like this:

```bash
Python 3.x.x
